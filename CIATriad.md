# 🔐 Lesson: The CIA Triad

## 🧠 What is the CIA Triad?

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational concept in cybersecurity. It stands for:

- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

These three principles are used to guide security policies, decisions, and best practices. Every security control, policy, or measure should support one or more parts of this triad.

## 🔍 Breakdown of the Triad

### 🔒 Confidentiality

**Definition:**  
Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information.

**Examples:**  
- Using **encryption** to protect data in transit or at rest  
- Implementing **access controls** (usernames/passwords, MFA)  
- **Data classification** and limiting who can see what

**Threats to Confidentiality:**  
- Eavesdropping/sniffing  
- Insider threats  
- Weak passwords  
- Misconfigured permissions

---

### 🧬 Integrity

**Definition:**  
Making sure data is **accurate** and has not been **altered** without authorization.

**Examples:**  
- **Hashing** files to detect tampering  
- **Checksums** and digital signatures  
- Logging changes to sensitive files

**Threats to Integrity:**  
- Data tampering  
- Malware modifying system files  
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

---

### 🕒 Availability

**Definition:**  
Ensuring that data and services are available when needed by authorized users.

**Examples:**  
- Regular **backups**  
- **Redundant systems** or failovers  
- **DDoS protection** and load balancing

**Threats to Availability:**  
- Denial-of-service attacks (DoS/DDoS)  
- Hardware failure  
- Natural disasters

## 🛠️ Optional Activity

Choose a real-world scenario and identify how each part of the CIA Triad is applied:

Example: Online Banking  
- **Confidentiality:** Encrypted login over HTTPS  
- **Integrity:** Transaction verification and digital signatures  
- **Availability:** 24/7 access with server redundancy

---

## ❓ Practice Questions

1. Which principle of the CIA Triad is violated when an attacker alters files on a server?
2. What type of attack impacts the availability of a service?
3. What tools or methods are commonly used to ensure confidentiality?

---

## ✅ Summary

The CIA Triad helps guide all cybersecurity planning and implementation. A security issue usually affects one or more parts of the triad. Understanding this model is essential for analyzing risks, designing controls, and responding to incidents.
